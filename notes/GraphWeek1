Principes of Analytic Graphic 
============================
1. Show comparisons
	*Ecidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis
	* "compared to what?"

2. show causality, mechanism, explantation, systematic structure 
	* what is your casual framework for thinking about a question

3. show multivariate data 
	* multivariate = more than 2 variables 
	* the real world is multivariate 

4. Integration of evidence 
	* completely integrate words, numbers , images, diagrams
	* data graphics should make use of man modes of data presentation 
	* don't let the tool drive the analysis 

5.describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels , scales , source 
	* data graphic should tell a complete stroy that is credible

6.  content is king 
	* analytical presentations ultimately stand or gall depending on the quality relevance and integrity of their content 

================================================
Exploratory Graphs 
=================

To understand  data properties 
To find patterns in data 
To suggest modeling strategies 
To debug analyses
To communicate result


characteristics of exploratory graphos
	* They are made quickly 
	* A large number ae made
	* the goal is personal understanding 
	* Axes/legends are generally cleaned up (later)
	* Color/size are primarily used for inforamtion 

boxplot(pollution$pm24, col = "blue")


hist(poluttion$pm, col = "green")

rug(polution$pm25)

hist(poluttion$pm, col = "green", breaks = 100) //make the bars smaller or bigger 


abline( h =12 ) 

abine (v = meadian(polltution$pm25), col = "magneta", lwd = 4)

barplot(table(pollution$region), col = "wheat", main = "number of cou....")


with(data, plot(latitude, pm25, col = region))  //plot 
> abline(h = 12, lwd = 2, lty =2)
============================================================
The 3 system for graphing 
1. The base plotting system
	* aretist platet model
3. use the plot function 



e.g library(datases)
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))

2. the lattice system 
xyplot, bwplot 
*you have to construct the whole function from the begining and is hard to add to it (compare to the base plotting system)

3. ggplot2 system in ggpot2 package 
	* mixes elements of base and lattice
useful for condition plot 


library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
gplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)


you can't mix the function between the 3 system
==================================================
The Base Plotting System in R
===============================
	* Initializing a new plot 
		plot(x, y) hist 
	* Annotating (adding to) an existing plot
		par

e.g 
library(datasets)
hist(airquality$Ozon)

with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozon))

boxplot <- tranform(airquality, Month = factor(Month)
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, airquality, xlab = "month", ylab= "Ozone (ppb) " )
	*
	pch plotting system 
	lty line type (dashed, dotted)
	lwd  line width 
	col  color 
	xlab character string for the x axis label 
	ylab character string for y axis label 
par()
	las the orientation of axis labels on the plot 
	bg background color
	mar margin size 
	oma outer margin size 
	mfrow number of plots per row 
	mfcol number of plots per row column plots

Default values 

par("lty") transparent
par("mar") //5.1 4.1 ..
par("mfrow") //1 1
