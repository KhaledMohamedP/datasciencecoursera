Raw data
	* the original source of the data
	* often hard to use for datay analyses
	* raw data may only need to be processed once 

Processed data
	* Data that is ready for analysis 
	* Processing can include merging subsetting, tranforming
	* there may be standards for processing
	* All steps should be recroded 

E.g:
	Raw data can go into different type of strapping steps to get the final result that would be use
==================
Four things should have 
	1. The raw data.
	2. A tidy data set
		* each var. u measured should be in one column
		* each different observation of that variable shoul dbe in a different row
		* there should be one table for each "king" of variable

	3. A code book describing each varaible and its values in the tidy dta set
		* information about the variables 
		* info about the summary choices you made
		* info about the experiment study design you used
		** they could be in word/text file title "Study Design"
	4. An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 -> 2, 3
		* Computer script R
		* the input raw data --> output tidy data 
		* There are no parameteres to the script 
		**instruction for your program 
			* you have to give sotware version and how to use the raw data

How to use R to download file
==============================
getwd() setwd()
Windows \\ vs linux / 

file.exists("directoryName") false/true if the file exists 
dir.create("directoryName") create directory 

if(!file.exists("data")){
	dir.create("data")
}


download.file() //download files from the Internet 
fileUrl <- "url"
download.file(fileUrl, destfile = "./data/cameras.csv", method = "curl") //curl is for https for mac
dateDownloaded <-data() //to check when file was downloaded

read.table() //is robust for reading data
	** not the best for reading large amount of data

cameraData <- read.table("./data/cameras.csv")
## error line 1 di not have 13 element
head(cameraData)
error

so .
cameraData <- read.table("./data/camera.csv", sep ="," , header = T)
sep --> sepration to ", " look through the file value serpated by , 
head ---> ignore the first line and label as header 
or....
read.csv


some other parameters for read.table
	* quote : you can tell R whether there are any quoted values quote ="" means * no quotes 
	* na.strings : set the character that represents a missing value 
	* nrows: how many rows to read of the file (e.g you can read the first 10 files by passing 10)
	* skip : pass int that represent how many line read.table should sip 

tips : set quote = ""  helps to read data if you encounter trouble 



reading excel file 
==================
read.xlsx()
read.xlsx("./data/cameras.xlsx", sheetIndex=1, header =T) 
you can pass colIndex, rowIndex to read specific files 


xml
libraru(XML)
fileUrl<- "url"
doc <- xmlTreePare(fileurl, useInternal=T)
rootNode <- xmlRoot(doc)
xmlName(rootNode)



htmlTreeparse(file, useInternal=T)

xpathSapply(file, "//li[@class='score']", xmlValue)
