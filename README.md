Data Science on Coursera
===================
A repo base on R programming and other learning tools from Coursera that would help expand my knowledge on Data Science. Looking forward to learn! 
 

About Data Science
===================

**What?**

> This specialization covers the concepts and tools you'll
> need throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking 
> the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. 
> The Specialization concludes with a Capstone project that allows you to apply the skills you've 
> learned throughout the courses.

**Why?**
- Formulate context-relevant questions and hypotheses to drive data scientific research
- Identify, obtain, and transform a data set to make it suitable for the production of statistical evidence communicated in written form
- Build models based on new data types, experimental design, and statistical inference
